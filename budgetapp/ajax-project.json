{"one":"1.  Understand the Goal: The goal of a budget is not to track every dime we spend. That’s certainly one way to budget, but it’s not the goal. In fact, one can know where all of their money is going and still not have an effective budget. The goal of a budget is to help us control our spending so that we can spend less than we make and focus our spending on what matters most to us. However you choose to budget, it should meet this goal. If it doesn’t, you’re doing it wrong.",
"two":"2.  Track Spending for a Week: While not the goal of budgeting, tracking every dime you spend for a short period of time will be eye-opening. It will show you how spending even small amounts of money adds up over time. It will also reveal areas of spending that otherwise go unnoticed. Ideally one should track their spending for a full month, but even tracking for a week can provide valuable information about your spending patterns.",
"three":"3.  Use the 3-Category Budget:  Given the goal of budgeting, most people do not need to track every dime they spend. For example, knowing how much you’ve spent on gasoline may be interesting, but if it doesn’t change your behavior, there’s no point in tracking this expense. Most people overspend in just a few categories. Common examples include eating out, buying clothes, buying gadgets, and entertainment. Using the data accumulated from tacking your spending, pick the three budget categories you’d like to bring under control, and monitor your spending in just these areas. The 3-Category Budget is easy to implement and can have a significant effect on your finances."}
